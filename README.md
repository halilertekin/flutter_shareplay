- üçÄ Reliable (using Apple server).
- üí∞ It's "free" (including in your paid Apple Developer subscription).
- üòå Very easy to implement (in 3 lines of code you can share data!).
- üôå Works accros iOS, macOS & tvOS.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **share_play** is only intended to use with **iOS 15.0+**!
> It will simply do nothing on other platform & < iOS 15.0

## üëª Getting started

Due to some **technical restriction**, it's not currently possible to only use Flutter ü´£.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can check into the [**example repository**](https://github.com/istornz/share_play/tree/main/example) for a full example.

- Open the Xcode workspace project ```ios/Runner.xcworkspace```.
- Enable "Group Activities" capabilities on the main ```Runner``` app.

- Import ```share_play``` & create an instance of the Plugin

```dart
import 'package:shareplay/shareplay.dart';

// [...]

final _shareplayPlugin = Shareplay();
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Quick start

- Add listener when a new message is received in ```initState()``` method for ex.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  
  // [...]

  _shareplayPlugin.dataStream().listen((data) {
    print(data);
  });
}
```

- Start a new activity.

```dart
_shareplayPlugin.start(title: 'My Activity');
```

- Join an activity from other device.

```dart
_shareplayPlugin.join();
```
